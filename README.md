# linear-regression
This dataset contains the information about the individual's demographic, lifestyle-related, insurances-related attributes along with their corresponding medical insurance charges. This project helps us to build the predictive model that can estimate the medical insurance charges for new individuals based on their characteristics.
## 1. Checking missing values

## There are no missing values in this dataset.
## 2. Correlation Plot

## Age and bmi are correlated at 0.2
## Age and chargers are correlated at 0.3 and they have the highest correlation among all variables
## bmi and age are correlated with 0.11 and it does not hold that signficant relationship.
## 3. Who smoke more? Men or Women?

## Women are the most number of non-smokers and men are the most number of smokers from this visualization.
## 4. Do people who have children smoke more?

## People who have atleast one to five year children or dependents smoke less compared to people who don't have children.
## It is people who don't have children that smoke more.
## 5. From which region are the smokers majorly from?

## Majority people who smoke are mostly from the southeast regions.
## 6. checking the residual distribution of the model prediction.

## As we can see that the residuals are not normally distributed.
## Lastly, after proceeding with the model training and evaluation, linear model comes up with the r2 score of 0.76.
